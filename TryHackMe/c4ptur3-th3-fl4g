Description: -
This is a decryption challenge which is mostly based on decrypting given question so each question would be answer one by one.

Report: -

TASK 01

The question 01: - c4n y0u c4p7u23 7h3 f149?
answer: - can you capture the flag (It was an easy decrypt from naked eye)

The question 02: - "01101100 01100101 01110100 01110011 00100000 01110100 01110010 01111001 00100000 01110011
01101111 01101101 01100101 00100000 01100010 01101001 01101110 01100001 01110010 01111001 00100000 01101111 01110101
01110100 00100001" ?
Ans: -lets try some binary out! (This was a binary therefore used binary decoding)

The question 03: - MJQXGZJTGIQGS4ZAON2XAZLSEBRW63LNN5XCA2LOEBBVIRRHOM====== ?
Ans: -base32 is super common in CTF's (This is Base32 therefore Base32 decoding)

The question 04: - RWFjaCBCYXNlNjQgZGlnaXQgcmVwcmVzZW50cyBleGFjdGx5IDYgYml0cyBvZiBkYXRhLg== ?
Ans: -Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data. (This is Base64 therefore Base64 encoding)

The question 05: - 68 65 78 61 64 65 63 69 6d 61 6c 20 6f 72 20 62 61 73 65 31 36 3f ?
Ans: -hexadecimal or base16? (This is a hex so hex encoding was done)

The question 07: - Ebgngr zr 13 cynprf! ?
Ans: - Rotate me 13 places! (This was a ceaser cipher on shift 13 therefore (ROT13) was used to encode)

The question 08: - *@F DA:? >6 C:89E C@F?5 323J C:89E C@F?5 Wcf E:>6DX ?
Ans: -You spin me right round baby right round (47 times) (This is also ceaser cipher on shift 47 therefore (ROT47) was used)

The question 09: - - . .-.. . -.-. --- -- -- ..- -. .. -.-. .- - .. --- -. . -. -.-. --- -.. .. -. --. ?
Ans: -telecommunication encoding (This is a morse code so morse code encoding is done)

The question 10: - 85 110 112 97 99 107 32 116 104 105 115 32 66 67 68
Ans: - Unpack this BCD (This is a decimal so decimal encoding was done)

The question 11: - (Note this is not the full question as the full question is very long)
LS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0KLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0
tLS0KLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLi0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0gLS0tLS0g ?
Ans:- Let's Make This A Bit Trickier... (Not the correct flag)

Base64 = Morse Code = Binary = ROT47 = Decimal = Answer

(This is a base64 after doing base 64 i got morse code which i after encoding morse code which 
gave me binary which i did encode binary then i got ROT47 then after ROT47 encoding 
i got Decimal then after that i did a Decimal encoding it gave me the answer.)

Task 02: -

Download the file 
Ans : - super secret message
(For spectrography its a hidden message in the recording. I used 
Audio-Analyzer to know the answer)

Task 03: -

Decode the image to reveal the answer.
Ans: -spaghettisteg
(For Steganography i used the website Stegnographic Decoder to find the answer.)

Task 04: -

Question 01: - Download and get 'inside' the file. What is the first filename & extension?
Ans: - hackerchat.png

Question 02: - Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text.
Ans: - AHH_YOU_FOUND_ME!

(Both the task can be done simultaneously with just downloading the image and command cat <filename> where filename 
is name of image file and at the "last 2nd line" is the first answer and second answer at just above first at the bottom section
of the gibberish just need to read it properly. Please dont read the whole gibersih from start the andwer is just at
bottom not in middile or top whereas in bottom.)

Tools Used: -

ChatGPT: - An AI tool was used to only know the type of encoding is it because i am not that proffesional yet

Cyber Chef (https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef): - This is a website where all the decoding is done for Task 01 

Audio-Analyzer (https://academo.org/demos/spectrum-analyzer/): - Used for spectography

Stegnographic Decoder (https://futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html) : - Used for stegnographic

Command used: -

cat <filename> for task 04

Note: - Some flags are altered to avoid cheating please dont cheat.
