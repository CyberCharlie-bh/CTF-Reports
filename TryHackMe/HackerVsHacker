Website: - TryHackMe

Description: -
The server of this recruitment company appears to have been hacked, and the hacker has defeated all attempts by the admins to fix 
the machine. They can't shut it down (they'd lose SEO!) so maybe you can help?

Machine IP: - 10.201.44.133

Part 01: - Intial Obervation for bug or exploit

At first a basic nmap scan was done to know the number of ports and services. After the scan there was both http and ssh open at 80
and 22 from which i went to the website which did not had usefull info at the beginning just a option to upload a file. So i 
decided to upload a php-reverse-shell.php from "Pentest Monkey" which failed and gave me a text that the attacker is not that dumb
to give access so easy (Classic THM Troll). So i decided to inspect the pagesource at the first site "http://MachineIP/" which 
gave me a info that the uploaded file goes into /cvs folder (Cool). From which i tried to gain access with "http://MachineIP/cvs"
which failed saying i cant access the directory. So then i decided to page-source both the /cvs and /upload.php (Upload.php is 
where THM trolled) which gave me a set of code in php. With the help of ChatGPt i understood the code it state that only .pdf
extension will be accepted. So the next phase .........

Part 02: - Gaining a access to the Machine

So i decided to change the extension of my php file to php-revrse-shell.pdf.php and then i tries to gain access but still faiked.
After trying for 10 th different i gave up and checked the writeup for a hint and it gave me a hint that it alerady has a file in
it that has reverse shell just needs to find it with the help of ffuf. So I used ffuf to give enumerate me the text file which 
worked and I got shell.pdf.php in the cvs. Shell.pdf.php was an IDOR vulnerablity so i had to use the command (At the bottom of 
the page) to know who is the user and getting reverse shell this failed due to some URL issues so i decided to use other way.
Burpsuite was used to intercpt the traffic and make changes in the header in the application where only part was working i added
the whole command which worked and it worked and i got the shell with help of netcat.
