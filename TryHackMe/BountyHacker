Machine IP: - 10.10.90.142

Part 01: - Gaining Machine Access
A first nmap scan was done to know the ports and services. After the scan three services were found ftp, http and ssh. First http 
was checked it had nothing of use after spending some time on it. I decided to check the ftp it showcases that it had anoyomous login
so it worked i put in the username and password as anoyomous and i got the login. It had two file first being tasks.txt and locks.txt.
So i used command get tasks.txt and get locks.txt to get the file which works and i got both file. From first file o got username 
"Lin" and using hydra i brute forced password of ssh as locks.txt as a wordlist. So after bruteforcing i got the password which was
"RedDr4gonSyndlcat3" (I changed the password to avoid cheating). Using ssh i got the shell with username and oassword.

Part 02: - Privilage Escalation
After i got the shell i did "ls" command which gave me user.txt flag. Then i tried sudo -l which gave me option of root by 
using /bin/tar. Then i used SUID commands to find the privilages i can esclate it still had that /bin/tar in it so i decided to
go to GTFO Bin to find a way to escalate the root so i used first the SUID Command in GTFO Bins and i got a shell but i wasnt root
it was of username "lin" so i decided to try thr SUDO command from GTFO Bins which i worked i got the root. I got the root.txt at
/root directory which gave me the last flag.
