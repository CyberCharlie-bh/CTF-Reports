Description: -
A ctf for beginners, can you root me?
It is divided into three tasks so I would start from Task 02 as Task 01 is based on openvpn (Basic stuff)

Report: -

Part A: Reconnaissance

In the first task was to find number of ports, version of system and what is running on the port. So a basic nmap scan is all that was needed to find the requires information
of the a bove question. So the nmap command "nmap -sC -sV MachineIP" which gave me all the neccessary requirements. Then the following question requires to find the 
hidden directory and all the directory which was done by the command "gobbuster dir -u http://MachineIP/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt" which gave me 
two important directories /panel and /uploads

Note: - The CTF Version is glitched it said 2.4.41 while the real answer was 2.4.29 which maybe because the CTF too old or human error.

Part B: - Getting a shell

I tried both the directory /panel and /uploads in which /panel gave me a option to upload a file which can be missused to gain a reverse shell. So i first decided to go with 
p0wny.php which failed because no php extension excepted so after some help from community i learnt i cna use either phtml or php5 extension so i went phtml extension. I
 went to /uploads to access the file and clicked on it. Which worked and I got the shell.

Part C: - Privilege escalation

I got the user flag on /home directory but for some reason after a many troobleshoot I couldnt gain access to the root. In the p0wny.php5 i learnt that 
python had the SUID permision which i can esclate to gain privilagess of root but was not working in p0wny.php. After doing some help with my team members i decided to use 
netcat to gain a reverse shell so i found the php file online in pentest monkey which with some changes in the file did the same process as p0wny.php5 to gain access.
I used "nc -lnvp 443" on my terminal and with help of "http://machineip/uploads/reverse-shell-php.php5".I gained the reverse shell in my terminal and after that 
i used the command "bash -i" to gain the bash shell on terminal then i used the SUID command for python "python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'" to gain the
root which worked and i gained the root so i went to read /root/root.txt which gave me the FINAL FLAG.

Note: - The changes made in revers-shell-php.php5 was just changing the ip address to my ip address and port number to my listening port. The python command was taken in 
from the GTFOBins python SUID.
